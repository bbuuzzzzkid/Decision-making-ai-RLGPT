# Decision-making-ai-RLGPT
An ai, trained by you, me and beforehand, can take a couple of items, with a provided criteria (e.g. apple,banana,chocolate = x , taste, cost healthiness is y.) and (optional) weight (default 1-1-1) of how much you want a criteria to matter. Like this: taste_weight = 0.5, healthy weight = 0.9, cost = 5. There you have it : a decision making ai!
